# Harmless Hacking
Hej! The purpose of this repo is to collect various features for changing computer settings—like desktop background, theme, or text size—through code.

In other words: how to harmlessly hack your friend's computer by sending them "test code".

P.S. The inspiration for this came from my uni friends, who used to change each other’s desktop images whenever someone left their laptop unlocked.
As an IT person, I thought—why not automate that? :)

Now I’m exploring different ways to modify system settings through code.

⚠️ Important: This is all meant in good fun. Nothing harmful. Only to be used with friends who understand the joke!
